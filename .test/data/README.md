# Data Notes

## indextable.tsv

The I2 sequences (i.e. i5 and r5) are the reverse complements of the original
sequences; this is only suitable if runs come from nextseq where I2 is sequenced
from 3' to 5'. For HiSeq data, the I2 sets given here have to be reverse
complemented to restore original sequences
